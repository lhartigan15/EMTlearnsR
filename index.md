## Welcome to the EMT-Learns-R Page
I will keep this page updated with our bi-weekly code files and recordings, practice exercises, and other resources. If you want to set up email alerts for updates/additions to this site, you can use the free version of a third-party program: [Distill](https://distill.io/). The free version will check for updates every six hours and send you alerts. Note: this is a third-party site and you should review their data privacy and security practices before deciding to download.

### General R Resources
- Instructions for installing/updating R and Rstudio can be found [here](./Downloading Installing Updating R and RStudio.pdf).
- [Here](./Intro to R_final.pptx) is a slide deck with helpful information for navigating and setting up R, knitting in R Markdown, and general troubleshooting tips.
