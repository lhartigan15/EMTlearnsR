## Welcome to the EMT-Learns-R Page
I will keep this page updated with our bi-weekly code files and recordings, practice exercises, and other resources. If you want to set up email alerts for updates/additions to this site, you can use the free version of a third-party program: [Distill](https://distill.io/). The free version will check for updates every six hours and send you alerts. Note: this is a third-party site and you should review their data privacy and security practices before deciding to download.

### General R Resources
- Instructions for installing/updating R and Rstudio can be found [here](./Downloading Installing Updating R and RStudio.pdf).
- [Here](./Intro to R_final.pptx) is a slide deck with helpful information for navigating and setting up R, knitting in R Markdown, and general troubleshooting tips.

-------|---------
[Exercise 1](./Exercise1.pdf) | due 11/8/21



#### YAML header
When you download an .Rmd file from this site, the YAML header will be removed (for some reason). Here is a sample header that you can paste at the top of your .Rmd file. Note, this MUST begin on line 1 of your .Rmd file and the formatting must stay consistent in order for it to work (e.g., must begin with three dashes and end with three dashes)
